# Data Mining Course Repository

Welcome to my Data Mining course repository! This repository contains all the exercises, projects, and explanations from my Data Mining course at TU. The goal of this repository is to document my journey in learning data mining techniques and share helpful resources with others who are interested in this field.

## About
Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data. It involves using techniques from statistics, machine learning, and database systems to extract useful information. This repository serves as a space where Iâ€™ll document my understanding of these concepts through course exercises and personal projects.

The course covers a variety of topics such as:
- Data preprocessing
- Classification and regression models
- Clustering algorithms
- Association rule mining
- Evaluation metrics
- And more!

## Course Topics
Here are some of the key topics covered in the course:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Classification Algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Naive Bayes)**
3. **Regression Analysis**
4. **Clustering (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN)**
5. **Association Rule Mining (Apriori, Eclat)**
6. **Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)**
7. **Big Data & Scalable Techniques**


## Exercises
Each folder in this repository contains a specific exercise from the course. Each exercise has:
- A **problem statement** and **instructions**
- A **solution** with code and explanations
- **Comments** and clarifications to make the process easier to understand

Feel free to go through the exercises and check the explanations if you are looking to learn or solve similar problems.

## Projects
In addition to individual exercises, I will be working on various projects that demonstrate the application of data mining techniques to real-world datasets. These projects will explore topics such as:
- Predictive modeling
- Customer segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Sentiment analysis
- And more!

Check the "Projects" folder to see the progress and findings from these projects.

## Resources
This repository also contains links to some useful resources:
- **Books:** Recommended readings and textbooks
- **Online Courses:** Links to free online resources and tutorials
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python libraries, R packages, and other software used in data mining
